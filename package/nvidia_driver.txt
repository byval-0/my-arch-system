To clean install nvidia driver, you better following this repository
https://github.com/korvahannu/arch-nvidia-drivers-installation-guide?tab=readme-ov-file

My GTX1060 is using Pascal Driver
So the latest driver that support as I know is nvidia-580xx-dkms

if you installed a newer version than this, your graphic card will not loded.

So, go ahead
$ yay -S nvidia-580xx-dkms nvidia-580xx-utils

Then you have to fix pacman to not upgrade this driver
go to /etc/pacman.conf

Add these to below # Pacman won't upgrade packages listed in IgnorePkg and IgnoreGroup
IgnorePkg = nvidia nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils nvidia-open nvidia-open-dkms

For yay
go to ~/.config/yay/config.json

and add this
{
  "IgnorePkg": [
    "nvidia-580xx-dkms",
    "nvidia-580xx-utils"
  ]
}
